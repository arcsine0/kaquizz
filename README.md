# This entire project is run on React
on each file i have commented a guide for how to use and where to put codes  
if i didn't, don't be shy to ask

# You only have to edit the clients folder
i haven't found a way to do a one-click setup for everything so it'll kinda be like the previous project  
i mean unless i make separate repo for the client and server, but that'll make it harder to maintain and update

# How to setup, because because
after cloning the repo, go to the client folder
```
cd client
```
and then install dependencies
```
npm i
```
that's it

# How to start the shi, because x3
just do
```
npm start
```
to exit, just do `CTRL + C`

anything else just ask me
